Architectural Review Preparation and Framing

**Background and Context:**  
For our project, our group is interested in learning more about AI and machine learning and how we could implement them into a game. We chose to use the Tron remake from Naomiâ€™s Mini-Project 4 as it provides a variety of methods in which AI and machine learning could be implemented for various forms of gameplay. Currently, we are struggling with AI implementation, and have had to put our plans for adding game modes and incorporating elements such as obstacles on hold. We initially tried to implement AI using A-star and Breadth-first techniques but found that they were not ideal for our game model. Instead, we are now trying to implement a minimax bot that uses a flood fill algorithm as our AI, which we have found useful because it detects the edges of trails and paths, backtracks, and can be altered to evaluate how boxed in the bot is. 

**Key Questions:**  
* What are your thoughts on our current plans moving forward?  
* Do you have any suggestions to clarify our code? What needs more commenting?  
* Do any of you have experience with minimax?   
* Do you think a stronger bot would use a more aggressive tactic (seeking to cut off its opponents) or a more defensive strategy (looking to survive the longest)?  

**Agenda for Technical Review Session:**  
1. Introduce the direction that we chose based on feedback from the last architectural review
2. Review things that have been accomplished since the last architectural review and progress on AI research
3. Live demo of existing code
4. Updated system architecture
5. Next steps
6. Converse
