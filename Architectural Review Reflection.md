Architectural Review Reflection


**Feedback and Decisions**  
	Based on the feedback form and in-class discussion, we intend to emphasize the multiplayer with CPUs aspect of our game. Our reviewers seemed to see little merit in the dynamic background mode, with most of our feedback surrounding user experience and the game’s features. In terms of graphics and visuals, our reviewers suggested adding more ‘tron-like’, less ‘pygame-like’ overall graphics feel, with sound effects, obstacles, and themes. More complex features such as adding physics (deceleration/acceleration/turning radius to the ‘bikes’) or multiple CPUs running on different AI architects were also suggested. Nearly all of our reviewers were strong proponents of the mixed player vs. player vs. CPU(s) mode. We intend to focus on the aforementioned mode, with an emphasis on trying different AI types over attempting to implement machine learning. Our new questions now surround which AI methods to implement.  

**Review Process Reflection**  
	In our opinion, we think that the review went pretty well. While we didn’t gain many resources for starting to learn about AI beyond the project toolbox, we did learn a lot about user interest and what direction people would like to see us to take with our game. In terms of context, we did a good job with providing enough information about the game we were trying to make so that the audience understood the basic mechanics of it, whether or not they had played it before. One thing that seemed a little unclear to the audience was our explanation of our proposed game modes as some of the questions they had showed that they weren’t fully confident on what we were trying to achieve. We went through our agenda as we had planned although the discussion afterwards branched out as our audience gave us feedback on our proposal. For next time, we think that we can be more clear in conveying our proposed plans so that we can get feedback on every aspect instead of having some topics avoided because they were unclear.
