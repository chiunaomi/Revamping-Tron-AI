Architectural Review 2 Reflection  

**Feedback and decisions**   
One of the main points of our architectural review was to show how we are pivoting in our AI implementation, and how we are adjusting our goals to accommodate that. While not too many people in the class had experience with minimax, they were generally supportive of implementing minimax with a flood-fill algorithm as opposed to A*. Paul’s comments regarding generalizing the minimax due to the variety of possibilities it could potentially have to backtrack through for each cell were very helpful. We also discussed our code structure, and while many thought that docstrings held the most effectual role in gaming code, they felt that ours should include inputs and outputs, and that the overall code could be clarified with some additional comments as well. We also talked a bit about the potential behaviors the bot could have, and the general consensus was that a defensive bot would probably be easier to begin with, as an aggressive bot would also need to predict the players’ next moves. However, many did think that once the minimax was refined it would be interesting to also attempt a more aggressive bot.

**Review process reflection**  
Overall, the review went fairly well. We were able to cover everything in the given time period and have lots of discussion throughout the review. We did get clear answers for our key questions. We provided all the necessary context for our audience, and because most of our questions were about formatting and our pivot choices, giving plenty of context was important to answering them.In terms of our planned agenda, we managed to stay on track and address all of the topics that we had in mind. We did have some minor edits in terms of the order in which each topic was presented as we ran into some technical difficulties, but overall, everything on our agenda had adequate time to be discussed and considered with our audience. For next time, we hope to have completed more of our AI so that our main focus for the project will not be solely technical and we can have more material to talk about with people who are inexperienced with implementing AI.
