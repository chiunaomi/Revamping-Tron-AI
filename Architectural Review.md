Architectural Review Preparation and Framing

Background and Context:
For our project, our group is interested in learning more about AI and machine learning and how we could implement them into a game. We chose to use the Tron remake from Naomiâ€™s Mini-Project 4 as it provides a variety of methods in which AI and machine learning could be implemented for various forms of gameplay. Currently, we have ideated many possible paths that we could take in improving the game and have not yet decided on which one to focus on. Among our considerations are creating CPUs to allow for single user play, having an adventure style gameplay mode where opposing CPUs increase in difficulty as the game level increases and creating a mode completely controlled by AI that would run independently to create Tron-styled art or backgrounds. While we do not currently possess the skills for making these gameplay modes possible, we have a clear idea of what we would like to achieve.

Key Questions:
- If you were to play this game, what functionality would you look for/ like to see?
- How can we make this more appealing to the user (you)?
- Which aspect of the program (P vs. P, P vs. P vs. CPU, CPU vs. CPU Dynamic Background) do you think we should emphasize?
- What features and graphics would make this aspect most appealing to you?
- Anyone have any resources/knowledge about where to start on AI?
- What are some different AI methods that we could explore?

Agenda for Technical Review Session:
1. Introduce what we would like to get out of the AR
2. Explain the background of our project
3. Introduce what we would like to see happen in our project
4. Converse
