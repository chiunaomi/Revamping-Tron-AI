## Story (Project Evolution/Narrative)

Our initial project goal was to learn about simple game-playing AI through designing and implementing a 'CPU' type player in a preexisting build of Tron Light Bikes created by one of our team's members in a previous project:

Initially, we intended to create a game with both AI and machine learning as well as varied playing fields that could include game modes, obstacles of various, and different levels. Our proposed game modes included the preexisting Player vs. Player mode as well as adding a Player vs. a combination of Players and CPUs, which could be selected from a splash screen. In addition, taking inspiration from another team member's previous project, a dynamic background mode in which multiple CPUs play each other to create random geometric art was proposed.

We all shared the common goals of gaining familiarity and comfort with working on a software project collaboratively, which was accomplished through compartmentalizing each class, allowing multiple team members to work on the project simultaneously without interfering with each other. Additionally, since none of us had any experience with game-playing AI, we all began the project with the goal of building a conceptual understanding of how it works, as well as gaining experience with building a rudimentary AI.


* Description of our motivations, goals, and game background
