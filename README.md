# Revamping Tron with AI

#### Current Status:
This readme has been updated to reflect our progress up until our first code review. Two different types of AI have been written, but have yet to be implemented. In parallel, the existing Tron game has been reformatted for ease of AI implementation and debugged.

### Description: 
This is a two or more player game based on the classic arcade game Tron. At least two players (either users of AI) compete for survival as they drive "light bikes" around a two dimensional playing field, leaving a "light wall" in their wake. Each player (or AI) attempts to box the other in, by forcing the other player to run into either their or their own "light wall", killing them. The winner is the last player left standing. 

Each player is controlled by W,A,S,D or the arrow keys.
