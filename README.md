####Revamping Tron with AI

#####Description:

At least two players (either users of AI) compete for survival as they drive "light bikes" around a two dimensional playing field, leaving a "light wall" in their wake. Each player (or AI) attempts to box the other in, by forcing the other player to run into either their or their own "light wall", killing them. The winner is the last to survive. 

The each player is controlled by W,A,S,D or the arrow keys.
