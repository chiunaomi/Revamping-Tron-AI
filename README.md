# Revamping Tron with AI
Updated 5/7/18

### Description:
This is a remake of the classic arcade minigame "Tron Lightbikes". In this survival style snake game, players compete to be the last one standing by avoiding the walls created by each player's path while staying within the playing field. With up to four players allowed to play at once, with any combination of players or AI controlled bots, this game allows for single player and multiplayer game modes.

Players are controlled using keyboard controls.
