# Revamping Tron with AI

#### Current Status:
This readme has been updated to reflect our progress as of 5/7/18. The existing code has been reformatted with better user interfacing allowing for single player and multiplayer game modes and variability of the number of players. Processes have also been incorporated to prepare for the integration of AI controlled opponents. Our AI algorithm has been written and is being edited for implementation which has not happened yet. 

### Description: 
This is a remake of the classic arcade minigame "Tron Lightbikes". In this survival style snake game, players compete to be the last one standing by avoiding the walls created by each player's path while staying within the playing field. With up to four players allowed to play at once, with any combination of players or AI controlled bots, this game allows for single player and multiplayer game modes. 

Players are controlled using keyboard controls.
